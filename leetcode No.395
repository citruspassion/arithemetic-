Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

//we need use hashmap to get the frequency of occurrence about this String.
//So we can find that which character is not repeated k times or less than k times.
//As a useless character we can throw it away by some ways. 
//And then if  we have already cut it off the useless parts,we would get some parts.
//for instance if the k euqals to 2,and the string is 'bbaaadb'
//we can throw d,so we can get bbaaa and b
//after doing these things, we can repeat by using recursion until we couldn't find any useless charater which is repeated less than k times.
//as the example above, b is not suit for the condition  we need,it will be throwed away. and as for bbaaa , there is no ways to split it,so the length of it is the answer.
